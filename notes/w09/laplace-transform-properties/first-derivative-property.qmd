## **Overview**

The **First Derivative Property of the Laplace Transform** relates the Laplace transform of a derivative $y'(t)$ to the transform of $y(t)$ and its initial value. The property states:

$$
\mathcal{L}[y'(t)] = s\mathcal{L}[y(t)] - y(0)
$$

This theorem is widely used in solving differential equations with given initial conditions.

## **Proof**

### Write the Laplace Transform of the Derivative

By definition, the Laplace transform of $y'(t)$ is:

$$
\mathcal{L}[y'(t)] = \int_0^\infty y'(t) e^{-st} \, dt
$$

### Apply Integration by Parts

The integration by parts formula is given by:

$$
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
$$

Let:

- $u = e^{-st}$ and $dv = y'(t) dt$,
- Then $du = -s e^{-st} dt$ and $v = y(t)$.

Using this formula:

$$
\int_0^\infty y'(t) e^{-st} \, dt = \left[ y(t) e^{-st} \right]_0^\infty - \int_0^\infty y(t)(-s e^{-st}) \, dt
$$

### Evaluate the Boundary Terms

1. At $t = \infty$, $y(t) e^{-st} \to 0$, assuming $y(t)$ grows no faster than an exponential function.
2. At $t = 0$, $y(t) e^{-s(0)} = y(0)$.

Thus, the boundary term becomes:

$$
\left[ y(t) e^{-st} \right]_0^\infty = -y(0)
$$

### Simplify the Remaining Integral

The remaining integral is:

$$
\int_0^\infty s y(t) e^{-st} \, dt = s \int_0^\infty y(t) e^{-st} \, dt
$$

By definition, this is:

$$
s \mathcal{L}[y(t)]
$$

### Combine Results

Substituting the results back into the equation:

$$
\mathcal{L}[y'(t)] = -y(0) + s \mathcal{L}[y(t)]
$$

Rearranging:

$$
\mathcal{L}[y'(t)] = s\mathcal{L}[y(t)] - y(0)
$$

### Conclusion

The proof demonstrates that:

$$
\mathcal{L}[y'(t)] = s\mathcal{L}[y(t)] - y(0)
$$

## **Summary**

The **First Derivative Property** establishes a relationship between the Laplace transform of a derivative and the transform of the original function, with an additional term involving the initial value of the function. This property is crucial for solving differential equations with initial conditions.
