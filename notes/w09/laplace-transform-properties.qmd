## Overview

The Laplace transform is a powerful tool for solving differential equations and analyzing systems. One of its fundamental properties is **linearity**, which allows us to compute the Laplace transform of linear combinations of functions.

## Linearity Theorem of the Laplace Transform

For every pair of scalars $a$ and $b$, and acceptable functions $f(t)$ and $g(t)$,

$$
\mathcal{L}[af(t) + bg(t)] = a\mathcal{L}[f(t)] + b\mathcal{L}[g(t)] \quad (\text{5.3.1 in some textbooks}).
$$

This theorem simplifies the computation of Laplace transforms for composite functions, as demonstrated in the following example.

## Example: Computing the Laplace Transform of $f(t) = 7 - 3e^{2t}$

### Problem

Find the Laplace transform of $f(t) = 7 - 3e^{2t}$.

### Solution

Using known transforms:

$$
\mathcal{L}[1] = \frac{1}{s} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathcal{L}[e^{2t}] = \frac{1}{s - 2}.
$$

Applying the Linearity Theorem:

$$
\mathcal{L}[7 - 3e^{2t}] = 7\mathcal{L}[1] - 3\mathcal{L}[e^{2t}]
$$

Substituting the known transforms:

$$
\mathcal{L}[7 - 3e^{2t}] = 7 \cdot \frac{1}{s} - 3 \cdot \frac{1}{s - 2}.
$$

Simplifying:

$$
\mathcal{L}[7 - 3e^{2t}] = \frac{7}{s} - \frac{3}{s - 2}.
$$

### Summary of Results

The Laplace transform of $f(t) = 7 - 3e^{2t}$ is:

$$
\mathcal{L}[f(t)] = \frac{7}{s} - \frac{3}{s - 2}.
$$

## Conclusion

The **Linearity Theorem** of the Laplace transform enables straightforward computation for functions expressed as linear combinations. This example highlights how to apply the theorem to efficiently compute the transform of $f(t) = 7 - 3e^{2t}$.
